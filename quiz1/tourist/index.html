				<strong>Nglirip Waterfall</strong><br><br>

				<strong>Coconut Beach</strong><br><br>
				The condition of this waterfall is still very natural and the trees that grow around it are very thick and big.
				This tourist spot is named coconut beach because indeed in this tourist location, various types of coconut trees with various shapes and sizes thrive.<br><br>
				In the past, visitors were only served with coconut trees and wide white sand, but for now visitors can find a bridge deck on a stage.
				The coolness of the coconut beach is second to none, because some coconut trees are quite dense and shady. 
				This is a strong reason why this beach in Tuban is always suitable as a port to rest a tired mind due to many work activities.

				<strong>Ngerong Cave</strong><br><br>
				So far, Tuban Regency is known as Seribu Goa. This term is certainly not just nonsense, in this district there are many caves that are very old and sometimes even sacred.
				One of the most famous caves in Tuban is Goa Ngerong which is located in Rengel District, Tuban Regency, East Java. 
				Goa Ngerong is famous for its beauty and the existence of springs that come out of the cave.
				In this cave, there are also tawes and turtles, which are one of the main attractions that until now still have uncovered myths.
				Apart from fish and turtles, during the day visitors can enjoy the thousands of bats hanging from the roof of the cave. 
				Apart from its beautiful nature, thousands of living things in Goa add to the uniqueness of Goa Ngerong.
